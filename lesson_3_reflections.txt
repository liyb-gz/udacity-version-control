When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am not in front of my computer but urgent to record a thought; when it is very urgent to fix a bug but, again I am not in front of my computer, etc.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may have updated your local repository and don't want the code that get pulled to your local repo to ruin your new updates. Manual pull will be safer.
