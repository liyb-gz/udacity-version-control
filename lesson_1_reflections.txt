How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helps me to focus on the lines that two versions are different.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I can compare between versions and have a good knowledge about how the files has been changed. I don't need to find the bugs line by line.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

When choosing to save manually, you know what a commit means, and it is logical; but you may forget to commit.
When choosung to save automatically, you don't need to worry about saving/committing, but you may get confused by the commits, and the number of commits may be too many.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git mainly aims for the projects that one single file cannot contains, and files are interrelated; while Google Docs mainly treats documents that are self-contained.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can use git log to browse the commits' changes and brief info, and use git diff to compare two commits and to find out the changes between the two.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I don't need to worry about changing things and deleting correct codes, as I can always roll back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To use it with my projects.
