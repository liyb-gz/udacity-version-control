What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git folder is created. You want the git to keep track on the folder.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You may add all files related to a particular logical change to the staging area, and commit. You may have other changes, but you can avoid mixing the commit by not adding them into the staging area.
